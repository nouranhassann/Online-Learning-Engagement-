# Online Learning Engagement Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student engagement in an online learning environment using a dataset of **9,180 student records**. The goal is to uncover patterns in student activity, identify factors affecting course completion, and provide actionable insights to improve online learning experiences.

## Workflow
The analysis follows a complete **data analysis pipeline**:

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed univariate and multivariate analyses.  
   - Created visualizations to identify key trends in engagement.  

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
   - Developed meaningful features to improve analysis insights.  
   - Applied selection techniques to retain relevant predictors.  

4. **Probability & Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Fitted distributions and calculated probabilities.  
   - Conducted statistical tests to validate engagement hypotheses.  

5. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**  
   - Reduced feature dimensions to visualize learner clusters.  

6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Provided actionable suggestions to enhance student engagement.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (PCA, Feature Selection)  
- Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

## Key Achievements
- Identified engagement patterns influencing course completion.  
- Visualized learner clusters using PCA for better segmentation.  
- Delivered actionable recommendations to improve online learning outcomes.
